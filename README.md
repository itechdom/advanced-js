# Why
This repo is a set of branches that are a series. Each branch represents a progression towards mastering JS build process and setup along with some javascript examples of different features in ES6,     React, Angular, Webpack and at the end I am hoping to cover Docker.

# Install and Run
run these commands in your terminal:

install global webpack dependency
```sh
npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server
```
install all local packages
```sh
npm install
```

to run the app:
```sh
webpack-dev-server --port 3000 --watch
```
